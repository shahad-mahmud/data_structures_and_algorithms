# Data structures and Algorithms

This repository holds the implementations from scratch of some data structures and algorithms. These are mainly implemented using raw Python. Some very early scripts are written in CPP also.

## How to use

Clone this repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahad-mahmud/data_structures_and_algorithms.git
```

### Directory structure

The repository is divided into two main directories, i.e `algorithms` and `data_structures`. The former one contains the scripts relater to several algorithms. Whereas the latter one contains data structures and data structure related algorithms. A detailed structure is as follows where a subdirectory name reflects the corresponding concept:

```bash
.
├── algorithms
│   ├── graph_algorithms
│   ├── parentheses
│   ├── pointers
│   ├── recursion
│   ├── searching_algorithms
│   └── sorting_algorithms
└── data_structures
    ├── array
    ├── graph_and_trees
    ├── heaps
    ├── linked_list
    └── stacks
```

### How to run

The scripts are generally written without external dependencies. However, if any needed, instructions are provided in the corresponding documentation.

To run a script, `cd` to the directory and run with appropriate commands. The scripts are simple and generally do not require any external arguments. An example:

```bash
cd data_structures/linked_list
python doubly_linked_list.py
```
